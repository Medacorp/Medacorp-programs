12-1-2026:
* Renamed "verify and assemble" to "World Manager"
* Added a reminder to update translations in the "World Manager" build program
* Added upside down language generator to "World Manager", and accompanying "upside down characters.txt"
** If a missing character is found, it asks what to treat it as, it'll then append the file with the missing character to it's replacement mapping
** This can be skipped by pressing Esc and inserts the character as-is

17-5-2025:
* Extracting vanilla assets is now threaded
* Added loading message for extracting vanilla assets, and fetching animation groups
* Texture atlas now only takes the textures used by the current entity, optimizing it greatly
* model pieces spawn in once again (but don't have offsets); reminder that ghosts'default data is invisible, so no models will show upon selecting them
* models now get their tints from the items, meaning a purple bat is actually purple now

16-5-2025:
* Replaced edit model button with change spawn function button
* Fix some mesh generator index out of bounds errors

4-4-2025:
* Meshes are now generated upon running MinecraftModel.ParseModels(string); no parts spawned in yet still

31-3-2025:
* Broke the Animator program to rewrite it; model parts are no longer spawned in
* Animator texture atlas is now global, and takes in both the vanilla and custom textures defined by Minecraft's blocks atlas
* Prompt upon selecting animation group now asks for a spawn function, instead of model files
** Spawn function is read, and a part is memorized for every line that contains an item (be it armor stand or item display)
** Item data is read, and item model, custom_data.model_data and custom_model_data fields are parsed
* Item model is parsed and used to select the models to display
** Currently only custom_model_data properties are used, others return (condition)false, (select)fallback, (range_dispatch)fallback
** Special models return empty model
** Tint types other than custom_model_data return the default; grass type returns plains' color

29-3-2025:
* Shared python functions and imports are now in a shared file
* Python program libraries that need to be installed are now automatically installed when running the program (and pip updated)
* "verify and assemble" world detetion no longer requires root folder name to match world name, as long as a gitignore, a world, and a resource pack exist, it'll succeed
