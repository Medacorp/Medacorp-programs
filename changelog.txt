4-4-2025:
* Meshes are now generated upon running MinecraftModel.ParseModels(string); no parts spawned in yet still

31-3-2025:
* Broke the program to rewrite it; model parts are no longer spawned in
* Animator texture atlas is now global, and takes in both the vanilla and custom textures defined by Minecraft's blocks atlas
* Prompt upon selecting animation group now asks for a spawn function, instead of model files
** Spawn function is read, and a part is memorized for every line that contains an item (be it armor stand or item display)
** Item data is read, and item model, custom_data.model_data and custom_model_data fields are parsed
* Item model is parsed and used to select the models to display
** Currently only custom_model_data properties are used, others return (condition)false, (select)fallback, (range_dispatch)fallback
** Special models return empty model
** Tint types other than custom_model_data return the default; grass type returns plains' color

29-3-2025:
* Shared python functions and imports are now in a shared file
* Python program libraries that need to be installed are now automatically installed when running the program (and pip updated)
* "verify and assemble" world detetion no longer requires root folder name to match world name, as long as a gitignore, a world, and a resource pack exist, it'll succeed
